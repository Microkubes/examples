#### Vue.js
Vue.js is an open-source JavaScript framework for building user interfaces. Vue can also function as a web application framework capable of powering advanced single-page applications. It features an incrementally adoptable architecture.
##### Webpack
Webpack is an open-source JavaScript module bundler. Its main purpose is to bundle JavaScript files for usage in a browser, yet it is also capable of transforming, bundling, or packaging just about any resource or asset. Webpack takes modules with dependencies and generates static assets representing those modules.
