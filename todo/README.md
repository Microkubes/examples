### Introduction

This is an example of a microservice for managing todos. Its purpose is to show how to use it within the Microkubes platform.

This repo is comprised of two parts:
- todo-service
- todo-webapp

`todo-service` contains the backend code to create an API built with Go.
`todo-webapp` contains the frontend code to consume the API and create the UI components built with Vue.js.

In each of these directories, there is a `README` file that has documentation on how to setup and start the backend and frontend.
